# pandas

## Aim

   Learn/recall some of the key concepts in using pandas for data analytics.

   You'll need to an IDE such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook to work with your Python programs.

## Basic Foundation Needed

It is assumed you already know the basics of Python before progressing into this topic. You can check out [here](https://colintwh.github.io/python/) to pick up Python basics otherwise.


## Why Python for Data Analysis?

Python's improved support for libraries (such as pandas and scikit-learn) has made it a popular choice for data analysis tasks in recent years. Combined with Python's overall strength for general-purpose software engineering made it an excellent option as a primary language for building data applications. 


## Topics:

The basic concepts you'll need using pandas for basic data analysis are organised in the following chapters:

1. [Creating, Reading, Writing](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/readdata.ipynb)
2. [Indexing, Selecting and Assigning](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/indexing.ipynb)
3. [Summary Functions and Maps](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/summary_maps.ipynb)
4. [Grouping and Sorting](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/group_sort.ipynb)
5. [Data Types and Missing Values](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/missing_val.ipynb)
6. [Renaming and Combining](https://github.com/colinat/pandas/blob/master/rename_combine.ipynb)
