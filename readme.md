# Data Analytics in Python

   This site seeks to introduce the key concepts in data analytics using Python programming language. The goal of this site serves as a reference source for those (myself included) who needs to recall some of the key concepts in data analytics using Python. It also serves as a learning site for those who wishes to grasp the basics of data analytics quickly.

   You'll need to have a recent version of Python installed on your computer to run the codes. You'll also need to install a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Jupyter to work with your Python programs.

### Python basics

It is assumed you already know the basics of Python before progressing into this topic. You can check out another of my site [here](https://colintanwh.github.io/python-basics/) to pick up Python basics otherwise.

### Why Python for Data Analytics?

Python's improved support for libraries (such as pandas and scikit-learn) has made it a popular choice for data analytic tasks in recent years. Combined with Python's overall strength for general-purpose software engineering made it an excellent option as a primary language for building data applications. 


## Contents:

The key concepts you'll need to perform data analytics using Python are organised in the following chapters, in the form of Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub:

    + [NumPy basics](https://github.com/colintanwh/python-analytics/blob/master/numpy.ipynb)
    + `pandas` Data Structures
    + Data Loading, Storage and File Formats
    + Data Cleaning and Preparation
    + Data Wrangling
    + Data Visualisation
    + Time Series
    + Modelling
